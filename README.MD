A more personally useful take on the traditional [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) project used to test out Javascript frameworks.

This project uses a standard feature set for an HTTP Client:

- All HTTP Verbs: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, PATCH
- Basic authentication
- Support for form-data, unencoded form, raw strings, and binary file request bodies
- HTML, XML, and JSON bodies are linted
- Request history stored in an IndexedDB
